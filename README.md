# Page Action Project

This is a simple web page that allows you to trigger a GitHub Action using a web form. The action takes three inputs (word1, word2, and word3) and concatenates them into a sentence. The resulting sentence is then displayed on the web page.

## Usage

To use this web page, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Edit the `script.js` file to include your own GitHub Personal Access Token.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Enter three words in the input boxes and click the "Run" button.
5. The resulting sentence should be displayed on the web page.

## Configuration

To configure the GitHub Action, edit the `.github/workflows/action.yaml` file. This file defines the action and specifies how to run it.

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature, please submit an issue or pull request.
